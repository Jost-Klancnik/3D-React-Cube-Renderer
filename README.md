# REACT 3D CUBE RENDERER

This is a React 3D Cube Renderer that uses **Only React** to render a 3D cube. 
Also fell free to use this code if you find any use for it.
## Why even do this?
I don't know, I was bored and wanted to see if I could do it.
## Current State
As of now I don't plan to work on this project any furtehr. It is not in the best state since it is quite laggy and unoptimised since I only started learning React. I may return to it some time in te future but for now it is what it is.
PRs are welcome if you want to improve it (I believe it won't be hard).
## Plans
- [x] Render a 3D cube
- [x] Fix rendering issues
- [x] Add ability to rotate cube
- [x] Add ability to change cube position
- [ ] ~~Add ability to change cube color~~
- [ ] ~~Add ability to change cube size~~
