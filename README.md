# REACT 3D CUBE RENDERER

This is a React 3D Cube Renderer that uses **Only React** to render a 3D cube. 
Also fell free to use this code if you find any use for it.
## Why even do this?
I don't know, I was bored and wanted to see if I could do it.
## Current State
Unfinished, I'm still working on it. It has some rendering issues where planes don't display properly, but I am working on fixing that soon.
## Plans
- [x] Render a 3D cube
- [x] Fix rendering issues
- [ ] Add ability to rotate cube
- [ ] Add ability to change cube color
- [ ] Add ability to change cube size
- [x] Add ability to change cube position
